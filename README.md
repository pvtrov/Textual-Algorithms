This repository contains solutions from my textual algorithms class at UST AGH. All solutions are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Reports with the obtained results are described in polish language.

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_1) includes the topic of finidng a pattern in a text using KMP algorithm and finite automaton.
