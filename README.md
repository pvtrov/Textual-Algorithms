This repository contains solutions from my textual algorithms class at AGH UST. All solutions are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Reports with the obtained results are described in polish language.

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_1) -> finidng a pattern in a text using KMP algorithm and finite automaton.
* [Lab 2](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_2) -> static Huffman encoding
* [Lab 3](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_3) -> Levenshtein distance (edit distance)
* [Lab 4](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_4) -> text clusterisation
* [Lab 5](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_5) -> two-dimensional pattern matching
* [Lab 6](https://github.com/pvtrov/Textual-Algorithms/tree/main/lab_6) -> Suffix tree - Ukkonen's algorithm
